## Project Summary:

- The project focuses on building an interactive Jeopardy-style game called “Jeopardy! Battle Arena”, where 2 players compete in real-time rounds of questions across various categories. 
- Each round will feature strategic betting, adaptive difficulty, and category mastery rewards.


## Key Features:

- **Homepage**: Introduces the game and starts a new multiplayer session with PHP session setup for player names and number of players.
- **Interactive Game Board**: Category grid with point values, hover animations, color changes, and real-time display of player turns and scores.
- **ynamic Question System**: PHP-powered question handling, scoring logic, turn switching, and special effects for correct/incorrect answers, Daily Double, and Final Jeopardy.
- **Player Scoreboard**: Shows player scores, names, and achievement badges with a responsive CSS layout using flex or grid.

## Functionalities:

- **Core Game Features**:

    - **Turn-Based System**: Players take turns selecting questions and answering them.

    - **Session-Based Score Tracking**: PHP sessions maintain player scores and category progress.

    - **Adaptive Question Difficulty**: Question difficulty scales based on previous correct answers.

    - **Buzzer Simulation**: CSS animation mimics a “buzz-in” effect for player turns.

- **Additional Key Features**:

    - **Daily Double Challenges**: Allows players to wager custom point amounts before answering a high-stakes question.

    - **Category Mastery Bonuses**: Unlockable achievements when players answer multiple questions correctly within the same category.

    - **Final Jeopardy Betting**: A final round where players wager portions of their score, testing strategy and knowledge.
